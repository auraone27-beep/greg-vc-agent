# Gregory Curtis × AuraPath AI
## Proposal: AI-Powered Intelligence Agents

*Prepared for Gregory Curtis*

## The Insight

You're already doing what AI does best — gathering information from scattered sources, synthesizing it, and making decisions. You proved it yourself with Claude: upload a data room, get an investment analysis back. It worked.

The question isn't whether AI can do this. It's whether it can do it *systematically* — every time, faster, more thoroughly, and getting smarter with each analysis. That's what we build.

## Two Pilots, One Platform

We're proposing two focused agents, each solving a different problem but built on the same intelligence layer. Start with one or both — either way, you'll see results in weeks, not months.

---

## Pilot 1: Political Race Tracker
**Replacing: $12-30K/year in political monitoring services**

### What It Does

An AI agent that continuously monitors political races relevant to your foundation's interests and delivers actionable intelligence — not raw data.

**Capabilities:**
- **Automated monitoring** across FEC filings, state election commissions, polling data (FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics), news sources, and campaign finance databases
- **Race analysis memos** generated on your schedule (weekly, biweekly, or on-demand)
- **Candidate profiles** with funding sources, voting records (via VoteSmart + ProPublica), policy positions, and endorsement networks
- **Impact scoring** — how does each race outcome affect your foundation's priorities?
- **Anomaly alerts** — sudden fundraising spikes, polling shifts, key endorsements
- **Strategy meeting prep** — one-click briefing package before any decision meeting

**Data Sources (mostly free, we handle the aggregation):**
- FEC / OpenFEC API — federal campaign finance (free)
- ProPublica Congress API — voting records, bills, committees (free)
- VoteSmart — candidate bios, ratings, positions (free)
- FiveThirtyEight — polling averages and forecasts (free)
- State election commission data — results and filings (free, fragmented)
- OpenSecrets — lobbying, PAC spending, donor analysis (bulk data)
- Ballotpedia / BallotReady — down-ballot coverage (paid, if needed)

**Deliverables:**
- Dashboard: real-time race tracking with your priority filters
- Weekly intelligence brief delivered to your inbox
- On-demand deep dives on any race or candidate
- Strategy meeting prep packages
- Historical analysis: spending vs. outcomes, what worked

**Why this is better than a monitoring service:**
A DC firm charges $12-30K/year for a human analyst scanning the same public data. Our agent scans *everything*, never sleeps, and remembers every data point from every prior analysis. By month 3, it knows your priorities better than a new analyst ever would.

## Pilot 2: VC Analysis Agent
**Replacing: 2-3 analysts × $130-450K/year each**

### What It Does

An AI agent that processes data rooms, generates investment memos, and builds comparative analyses — structured the way your investment committee expects.

**Capabilities:**
- **Data room ingestion** — upload financials, pitch decks, market reports. Agent extracts and structures everything.
- **Investment memo generation** — full committee-ready memo: executive summary, market opportunity, business model, traction, team assessment, competitive landscape, financial projections, risks, recommendation
- **Comparative analysis** — evaluate multiple deals side-by-side against your criteria
- **Sector intelligence** — deep dives on verticals you're active in (circular economy, waste-as-supply-chain, etc.)
- **Due diligence checklists** — tracks what's been reviewed, what's missing, what needs follow-up
- **Confidence scoring** — every conclusion comes with a confidence level and the data behind it

**For Your Circular Economy Focus:**
- Specialized metrics: diversion rates, material recovery, carbon avoidance, feedstock cost vs. virgin parity
- Market mapping across the $150B+ circular economy space
- Competitive positioning against Veolia, Rubicon, AMP Robotics, Redwood Materials, and emerging players
- Regulatory tailwind tracking: EPR laws, recycled content mandates, landfill bans

**Deliverables:**
- Investment memo template customized to your committee's format
- Per-deal analysis: upload → 48-hour turnaround on draft memo
- Sector reports for active verticals
- Deal comparison dashboard
- Pattern learning: the agent remembers what your committee cares about and adjusts

**Why this is better than an analyst team:**
A 2-person analyst team costs $400-900K/year fully loaded. They handle maybe 3-4 deals per quarter thoroughly. Our agent handles unlimited deals at consistent quality, with 48-hour turnarounds instead of 2-week cycles. The human stays where they add the most value — judgment, relationships, and final decisions.

---

## The Intelligence Layer

Both agents run on our **Closed Loop** — a self-improving system that:

1. **Collects** data continuously from all connected sources
2. **Analyzes** against your criteria and priorities
3. **Delivers** structured output (memos, briefs, alerts)
4. **Learns** from your feedback — which analyses were useful, which missed the mark
5. **Improves** — every cycle is better than the last

After a quarter, the agent knows your investment thesis, your political priorities, and your committee's preferences. It doesn't just process data — it thinks like your team.

## Investment

### Pilot 1: Political Race Tracker

| Component | Investment |
|-----------|-----------|
| Setup + configuration | $5,000 one-time |
| Monthly operation | $3,000/mo |
| **Year 1 total** | **$41,000** |

*Replaces: $12-30K/year monitoring service + analyst time for synthesis*

### Pilot 2: VC Analysis Agent

| Component | Investment |
|-----------|-----------|
| Setup + customization | $8,000 one-time |
| Monthly operation | $5,000/mo |
| **Year 1 total** | **$68,000** |

*Replaces: $400-900K/year analyst team (or significant portion of their workload)*

### Both Pilots Together

| Component | Investment |
|-----------|-----------|
| Combined setup | $10,000 one-time (bundled discount) |
| Monthly operation | $7,000/mo |
| **Year 1 total** | **$94,000** |

*Combined savings vs. alternatives: $300K-800K+/year*

**Minimum commitment:** 3 months per pilot

## Timeline

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Kickoff: data source connections, memo template review, priority calibration |
| 2-3 | Pilot 1 live: first political intelligence brief delivered |
| 3-4 | Pilot 2 live: first deal analysis processed |
| 4-6 | Refinement: feedback loop, adjust analysis depth and format |
| 6+ | Autonomous operation with continuous improvement |

**Strategy meeting prep:** If you have a meeting coming up soon, we can deliver a V1 memo as proof of concept within the first week.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose your starting point** — one pilot or both
2. **Share your templates** — investment memo format, political briefing preferences
3. **Provide access** — data room for a current deal, list of priority races/issues
4. **We deliver a sample** — first output within 1 week of kickoff
