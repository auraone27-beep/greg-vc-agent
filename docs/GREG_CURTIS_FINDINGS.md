## Executive Summary

Greg runs an environmental foundation as a solo operator — making political funding decisions and evaluating investment opportunities at a level that typically requires a full team. He's doing $2M/year worth of work by himself, and he's already experimenting with AI to keep up.

Through our discovery session, we identified two high-impact products that would multiply Greg's capacity: an autonomous Political Race Analysis Agent and a Digital VC Due Diligence Team Agent. Both replace specialized analyst work with AI systems that run faster, never miss data, and scale with his ambitions.

## Key Findings

### 1. One Person Doing a Team's Work
**Finding:** Greg performs political research, candidate evaluation, investment due diligence, legal review, financial modeling, and strategic planning — solo. This is the work of 3-5 specialized analysts.

**Impact:** Capacity is the bottleneck. Not skill, not funding, not deal flow. Greg can only evaluate so many races and so many deals in a week. Opportunities are being missed.

**Our Solution:** Two AI agent systems that each replace a specialized analyst function. Greg stays in the driver's seat — AI does the heavy lifting.

### 2. Political Research Is Manual and Time-Consuming
**Finding:** Making political funding decisions requires cross-referencing data across FEC, OpenSecrets, BallotReady, Ballotpedia, ProPublica, and polling sources. Greg does this manually for every race he evaluates.

**Impact:** Evaluating a single race takes hours. Monitoring the full landscape across federal, state, and local levels is impossible solo. Funding decisions are reactive, not proactive.

**Our Solution:** Political Race Analysis Agent — continuously monitors races, evaluates candidates against Greg's criteria (environmental policy focus), cross-references all data sources, and produces weekly actionable memos. Greg reads the memo, makes the decision.

### 3. Deal Evaluation Takes a Week Per Opportunity
**Finding:** Investment due diligence requires legal analysis (contracts, terms, IP), financial analysis (projections, valuations, burn rate), and business analysis (market, competition, team). Greg does all three sequentially.

**Impact:** One week per deal means the foundation's 5% investment allocation can't be deployed at scale. Good deals pass by while Greg is still evaluating the last one.

**Our Solution:** Digital VC Team Agent — three parallel AI analysts (legal, financial, business) process a data room simultaneously. What takes a week becomes hours. Greg evaluates the unified report, not raw documents.

### 4. Greg Already Gets AI
**Finding:** Greg has experimented with Claude manually for research tasks. He understands the potential but needs structured, reliable systems — not ad hoc prompting.

**Impact:** Low adoption risk. Greg won't need convincing that AI works. He needs to see that our system is better than doing it himself in Claude.

**Our Approach:** Working prototypes that demonstrate the structured workflow — data ingestion, parallel analysis, formatted output. Show him the difference between prompting and a purpose-built system.

## Products

- Runs three parallel analyses simultaneously:
  - Legal: contracts, terms, regulatory, IP
  - Financial: projections, valuations, burn rate, cap table
  - Business: market sizing, competition, team, product-market fit
- Produces unified due diligence report with risk flags and recommendations

**Input:** Data room documents (drag and drop or link)

**Output:** Comprehensive due diligence report in hours, not weeks

## Investment Options

### Option A — Political Race Agent Only
- **Setup:** $12,000
- **Monthly:** $4,000/mo
- **Year 1:** ~$60,000
- *Replaces a political research analyst ($65-80K/yr + benefits). Runs 24/7, never misses a race.*

### Option B — Digital VC Team Agent Only
- **Setup:** $15,000
- **Monthly:** $5,000/mo
- **Year 1:** ~$75,000
- *Replaces legal + financial + business analyst for deal diligence ($250K+/yr combined). Evaluates deals in hours, not weeks.*

### Option C — Both Products (Bundle)
- **Setup:** $22,000 (save $5,000)
- **Monthly:** $8,000/mo (save $1,000/mo)
- **Year 1:** ~$118,000
- *Full analyst team replacement. 2-3× Greg's capacity for a fraction of the cost of hiring.*

**The ROI math:** Greg does $2M/year of work solo. $118K/year to multiply his capacity and never miss an opportunity is a clear investment, not an expense.

**Our Recommendation:** Option C. Both products complement each other — the political agent identifies where to deploy funding, the VC agent evaluates where to deploy capital. Together, they make Greg's foundation exponentially more effective.
