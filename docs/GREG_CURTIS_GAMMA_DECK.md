## Deck Structure (10-12 slides)

### Slide 1 — Title
**Gregory Curtis × Aurapath AI**  
*Your Foundation, Amplified*

### Slide 2 — The Challenge
- Solo operator doing $2M/year of team-level work
- Political research: manual, time-consuming, reactive
- Deal evaluation: 1 week per opportunity, sequential analysis
- Capacity is the bottleneck — not skill, not deal flow
- Opportunities are being missed

### Slide 3 — What If You Had a Full Team?
- A political research analyst who monitors every race, 24/7
- A legal analyst, financial analyst, and business analyst — working in parallel
- Weekly memos. Deal reports in hours. Nothing falls through the cracks.
- That's what we're building.

### Slide 4 — Two Products, One Mission
Visual overview:
1. 🏛️ Political Race Analysis Agent
2. 📊 Digital VC Team Agent
Both feed Greg's decision-making — where to fund, where to invest

### Slide 5 — Political Race Analysis Agent
- Continuous monitoring: federal, state, local races
- Evaluates candidates against your criteria (environmental policy)
- Cross-references FEC, OpenSecrets, ProPublica, polling data
- Weekly actionable funding memos
- Identifies high-impact opportunities and funding gaps
- *Screenshot/mockup of memo output*

### Slide 6 — Political Agent: How It Works

- Three AI analysts work simultaneously:
  - 🔍 Legal: contracts, terms, regulatory, IP
  - 💰 Financial: projections, valuations, burn rate, cap table
  - 📈 Business: market sizing, competition, team, PMF
- Hours, not weeks
- *Screenshot/mockup of due diligence report*

### Slide 8 — VC Agent: How It Works
Flow diagram:
Data Room Upload → Parallel Analysis (Legal + Financial + Business) → Unified Report (risk flags, scores, recommendation) → Greg's Decision
