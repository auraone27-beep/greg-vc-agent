- Quick recap of intro call takeaways
- Confirm the two pilot projects we're exploring today

---

## Pilot 1: Political Race Analysis Agent (25 min)

### Current Workflow
- Walk us through how political funding decisions are made today, step by step
- Who's involved? (Patagonia internal contact, family advisor, Greg, others?)
- What does the final output look like? (Memo? Spreadsheet? Verbal recommendation?)

### Data & Sources
- Where do you get candidate/race information today?
- Which data sources are paywalled vs. public?
- What accounts or subscriptions do you currently have?
- On a scale of 1–10, how confident are you the data exists — it just needs to be accessed and organized?

### Desired Future State
- What would the ideal weekly/monthly deliverable look like?
- Dashboard vision: What metrics matter most? (Polling trends, spend vs. impact, geography breakdown?)
- Who needs to see this? Just you, or the broader team?

### Timeline
- You mentioned a strategy meeting coming up — when is it?
- Would a V1 memo for that meeting be valuable as a proof of concept?

## Pilot 2: Digital VC Team Agent (25 min)

### Current Workflow
- Walk us through your manual Claude experiment — what worked, what didn't?
- What does a typical diligence data room contain? (Financials, pitch decks, industry reports?)
- How do you evaluate companies today? What criteria matter most?

### Investment Committee
- Who sits on the committee? What do they expect?
- What does a standard investment memo look like? (Can you share a template or example?)
- What are the approval/review checkpoints?

### Desired Future State
- How many companies do you anticipate evaluating per quarter?
- What's the ideal output? (Scored memos? Comparative analysis? Recommendation with confidence level?)
- How much human review do you want at each stage?

### The Two Current Deals
- Both in "waste as supply chain" — can you tell us more about each?
- What stage are they at? What data do you already have?
