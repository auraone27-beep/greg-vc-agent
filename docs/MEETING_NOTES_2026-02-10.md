# Gregory Curtis - Intro Call Notes
_Date: February 10, 2026 | Duration: 30 min | Via: Google Meet_
_Attendees: Gregory Curtis, Brandon Slicklein, Travis Johnson_

## Client Overview
- **Name:** Gregory Curtis
- **Organization:** Environmental nonprofit/family foundation (connected to Patagonia)
- **Connection:** Brandon's cousin Alex
- **Role:** Manages grant-making, political funding, and exploring startup investing
- **Current tools:** Salesforce ($8,600/yr, 1 license, hates it), has Copilot license, tried Anthropic manually

## Two Pilot Projects

### Pilot 1: Political Race Analysis Agent
- Replace expensive DC lobbyists with automated research
- Identify high-value races (state, county, judicial) based on statistical probability
- Generate memos for internal strategy meeting (happening next week from call date)
- Live dashboard tracking polling data for funded and potential races
- Data sources: Public election commissions (state/county), polling data providers (some paywalled)
- Gregory confirmed: AI can use his account credentials to access paywalled sources
- Internal person at Patagonia (former DC worker) currently does this human-to-human
- Goal: Data-driven grant-making vs "friends and family" bias

### Pilot 2: Digital Venture Capital Team
- Enable startup investing without hiring full investment team
- Focus: "waste as supply chain" / circular economy companies
- Agent automates: due diligence, financial doc analysis, industry reports, competitive landscapes
- Prepares investment memos with recommendations for investment committee
- Gregory manually tested with Claude (download docs → upload → analyze) — found it valuable but inefficient
- Human-in-the-loop: Multiple review/approval points throughout process

## Key Quotes
- "I want to be more efficient at deploying capital, making better decisions, removing bias"
- "Can I just create these agents so that I can be more informed at any moment of the day?"
- "I keep trying to figure out where all of my data would sit"
- "Let's experiment. I think this sounds like... can we do a proposal for both?"

## Gregory's Mindset
- Not technical but has done technical work early in career
- Recently had mind-blown moment about AI (Alex told him about AI social networks, cryptocurrencies, AI hiring humans)
- Feels "completely ignorant" about pace of change — excited but unsettled
- Frustrated with Salesforce, tools that don't work together
- Already validated concept manually — wants to go from manual to automated

## Budget Signals
- Salesforce renewal: $8,600/yr for 1 license
- Currently pays DC lobbyist (expensive, hard to reach)
- Would need to hire investment analysts team without AI ($$$)
- Nonprofit budget constraints but willing to invest

## Action Items
- Discovery session: Feb 13 (today!) 2:30-4:00 PM PT
- Brandon & Travis: Prepare proposals for both pilot projects
- Gregory: Attend discovery to map current workflows
